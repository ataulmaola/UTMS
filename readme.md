# Welcome to ITMS!

## Overview


ITMS is a powerful, consistent, and flexible thesis management system. Built using the laravel framework, ITMS provides a simple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in and hacking on the code. Mezzanine is BSD licensed and supported by a diverse and active community.

In some ways, Mezzanine resembles tools such as Wordpress, providing an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form data, store products, and other types of content. But Mezzanine is also different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of modules or reusable applications, Mezzanine provides most of its functionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and efficient platform.

Visit the Mezzanine project page to see some of the great sites people have built using Mezzanine.
